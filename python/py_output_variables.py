Output Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".
For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:

"""
x = "Python is awesome."
print(x)

print("\nprint, mutiple output ")
k = "Python"
i = "is"
j = "awesome"
print(k, i, j) # output multiple variables, separated by a comma

print('\n')
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

print("\n")
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y) # the + character works as a mathematical operator:


x = 5
y = "John"
print("\n", x, y)
